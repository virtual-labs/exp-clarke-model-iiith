      "question": "What does isotropic antenna gain pattern mean?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The power gain term at the antenna DOES NOT depend on the angle of arrival of the signal",
        "b": "The power gain term at the antenna DOES NOT depend on the phase of the received signal",
        "c": "Both of the above",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Isotropic antennas radiate or receive power equally in all directions, so gain is independent of the angle of arrival.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Phase is not directly related to antenna gain pattern.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Only option (a) is valid for isotropic pattern.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Option (a) is valid."

      "question": "If a channel has a complex Gaussian gain term, i.e., the received signal is y = Hx + w, and all the entries of the H matrix are complex Gaussian, then select the correct option",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The magnitude of the received signal gain is Rayleigh distributed and the phase is Gaussian distributed",
        "b": "The magnitude of the received signal gain is Chi-square distributed with no. of degrees of freedom equal to the rank of the H matrix and the phase is uniformly distributed in [0, 2π]",
        "c": "The magnitude of the received signal gain is Rayleigh distributed and the phase is uniformly distributed in [0, 2π]",
        "d": "The magnitude of the received signal gain is Chi-square distributed with no. of degrees of freedom equal to the rank of the H matrix and the phase is Gaussian distributed"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The phase is not Gaussian distributed.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The gain of a single complex Gaussian channel is Rayleigh, not Chi-square.",
        "c": "Correct. For complex Gaussian variables, magnitude is Rayleigh distributed and phase is uniformly distributed in [0, 2π].",
        "d": "Incorrect. The phase is uniformly distributed, not Gaussian."

      "question": "What is the relation between the auto-correlation of a random signal and its power spectral density?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The auto-correlation is the Fourier transform of the power spectral density",
        "b": "The power spectral density is the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation",
        "c": "They are not related in the case of random signals",
        "d": "The power spectral density is the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation if and only if the process is Gaussian"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This reverses the actual relationship.",
        "b": "Correct. According to the Wiener-Khinchin theorem, the PSD is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function.",
        "c": "Incorrect. They are related for wide-sense stationary random processes.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The relationship holds for any wide-sense stationary process, not just Gaussian."
