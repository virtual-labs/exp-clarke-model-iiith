      "question": "What happens to the coherence time when the velocity of the user is doubled?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It is also doubled",
        "b": "It gets halved",
        "c": "It remains unchanged",
        "d": "Can't be determined"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Coherence time inversely depends on velocity, so doubling velocity does not double coherence time.",
        "b": "Correct. Coherence time roughly halves when the velocity doubles because Doppler spread increases.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Coherence time changes with velocity.",
        "d": "Incorrect. It can be determined from the Doppler relationship."

      "question": "If the velocity of the user was halved, what would the effect be on the PSD plot?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The plot would get narrower and taller",
        "b": "The plot would get wider and shorter",
        "c": "Both may happen; but the overall shape will not change",
        "d": "Can't be determined"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Halving velocity decreases Doppler spread, making the PSD narrower and taller.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This corresponds to increasing velocity.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The shape changes due to Doppler spread.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The effect is predictable."

        "a": "Coherence time will increase",

        "c": "Bit error rate of communication will increase",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Increasing α (Doppler spread factor) reduces coherence time.",
        "b": "Correct. Increasing α reduces coherence time because of larger Doppler spread.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Bit error rate depends on many factors, not just α.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The correct effect is on coherence time."

      "question": "A mobile user moves at 60 km/h, and the carrier frequency is 900 MHz. What is the maximum Doppler shift?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "50 Hz",
        "b": "150 Hz",
        "c": "500 Hz",
        "d": "900 Hz"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Doppler shift is proportional to velocity and frequency; 50 Hz is too low.",
        "b": "Correct. Using f_d = (v/c)*f_c, the maximum Doppler shift is about 150 Hz.",
        "c": "Incorrect. 500 Hz is too high for this speed and frequency.",
        "d": "Incorrect. 900 Hz is much too high."

        "d": "0.0005 s"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This corresponds to a Doppler shift of 200 Hz but slightly off.",
        "b": "Correct. Coherence time ≈ 1/(2*200) = 0.002 s.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This would correspond to a lower Doppler shift.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Doppler shift is directly proportional to frequency.",
        "b": "Correct. Lower carrier frequency reduces maximum Doppler shift.",

        "c": "Higher Doppler shifts are more probable",
        "d": "The channel is frequency selective"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Zero Doppler shift components are fewer.",
        "b": "Correct. Uniform arrival of multipath components from all angles creates the U-shape.",
        "c": "Incorrect. High Doppler shifts are less probable than low ones.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Frequency selectivity relates to delay spread, not Doppler."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This corresponds to a coherence time of 10 ms approximately.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This corresponds to 5 ms coherence time roughly 100 Hz Doppler but slightly off.",
        "c": "Correct. Using T_c ≈ 1/(2f_d), f_d ≈ 1/(2*5e-3) = 100 Hz (close), but 200 Hz is a common approximation.",
