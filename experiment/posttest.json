      "question": "What happens to the coherence time when the velocity of the user is doubled?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It is also doubled",
        "b": "It gets halved",
        "c": "It remains unchanged",
        "d": "Can't be determined"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Coherence time is inversely proportional to Doppler spread, which increases with velocity. So doubling velocity halves coherence time.",
        "b": "Correct. Coherence time is inversely proportional to velocity, so it gets halved.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Coherence time changes with velocity.",
        "d": "Incorrect. It can be determined from the relation with velocity."

    {
      "question": "If the velocity of the user was halved, what would the effect be on the PSD plot?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The plot would get narrower and taller",
        "b": "The plot would get wider and shorter",
        "c": "Both may happen; but the overall shape will not change",
        "d": "Can't be determined"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Lower velocity means smaller Doppler spread, which narrows the spectrum and increases the peak.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This describes an increase in velocity.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The shape changes as Doppler spread changes.",
        "d": "Incorrect. It can be determined based on Doppler spread."

      "question": "What happens if we increase the value of α?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Coherence time will increase",
        "b": "Coherence time will decrease",
        "c": "Bit error rate of communication will increase",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Increasing α typically leads to faster channel variations, reducing coherence time.",
        "b": "Correct. A higher α means higher Doppler, so lower coherence time.",
        "c": "Incorrect in this context. BER may change but isn't the primary effect of α.",
        "d": "Incorrect. There is a direct effect on coherence time."
