The objective of this experiment is to understand the following:
1) The system model of Clarke's model
2) How it deals with multipath including Doppler shifts
3) A discrete-time mathematical model of the received signal
4) How to make sense of the mathematical expressions for the auto-correlation and power spectral densities which will be derived
5) Coherence time of the channel in this setting
