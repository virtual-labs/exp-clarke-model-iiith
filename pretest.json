      "question": "What does isotropic antenna gain pattern mean?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The power gain term at the antenna DOES NOT depend on the angle of arrival of the signal",
        "b": "The power gain term at the antenna DOES NOT depend on the phase of the received signal",
        "c": "Both of the above",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. An isotropic antenna radiates or receives power equally in all directions, so gain is independent of angle.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Isotropic gain is about angle dependence, not phase dependence.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Only angle independence is true here.",
        "d": "Incorrect. 'a' correctly describes isotropic gain."

      "answers": {
        "a": "The magnitude of the received signal gain is Rayleigh distributed and the phase is Gaussian distributed",
        "b": "The magnitude of the received signal gain is Chi-square distributed with degrees of freedom equal to the rank of the H matrix and the phase is uniformly distributed in [0, 2π]",

        "d": "The magnitude of the received signal gain is Chi-square distributed with degrees of freedom equal to the rank of the H matrix and the phase is Gaussian distributed"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The phase is uniform, not Gaussian.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Chi-square distribution describes power sums, but phase is always uniform.",
        "c": "Correct. Complex Gaussian channel gains result in Rayleigh distributed magnitude and uniform phase.",

      "question": "What is the relation between the auto-correlation of a random signal and its power spectral density?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The auto-correlation is the Fourier transform of the power spectral density",
        "b": "The power spectral density is the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation",
        "c": "They are not related in the case of random signals",
        "d": "The power spectral density is the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation if and only if the process is Gaussian"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This reverses the correct relationship.",
        "b": "Correct. The power spectral density (PSD) is the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation function.",
        "c": "Incorrect. They are always related via Fourier transform for wide-sense stationary signals.",

      "question": "In Clarke's model, what is assumed about the angles of arrival of multipath components?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "They arrive from only one direction",
        "b": "They are uniformly distributed over [0, 2π]",
        "c": "They follow a Gaussian distribution",
        "d": "They depend on the Doppler frequency"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Multipath components arrive from many directions.",
        "b": "Correct. Clarke’s model assumes uniform distribution of arrival angles over the full circle.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Arrival angles are uniformly, not Gaussian, distributed.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Doppler frequency depends on velocity and angle, but distribution is uniform."
